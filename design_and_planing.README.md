# 2. Design & Planning

> **Suggested Time frame:** 3-4 days
>
> **Note:** Please do NOT start coding during this phase

## Summary

By the end of this phase, each group should have;

- tickets prepared for their first sprint
- designed wireframes and / or mockups which can be used to shape the design of the frontend
- their database entities described and have had this signed off by a teacher

6. [Research technologies (optional)](<#6-research-technologies-(optional)>)
7. [Come up with a group name!](#7-come-up-with-a-group-name!)

### 1. Create user stories

Identify and record potential usage scenarios for your application;

- What are the needs of the user?
- What is the user journey?
- Capture what the customer wants without using technical terms

> **Example:** _"As a user, I would like toâ€¦"_

### 2. Design the application layout

Some points for the students to keep in mind when creating visual mockups of the application;

- Color scheme
- Logo
- Visual themes

### 3. Identifying database entities

- What information does the application need to store?
- How is the data being used?
- Is there a relationship between the data?

> You are encouraged to get a teacher to sign off on this.

### 4. Create tasks and prioritize them

Using the project management tool, identify what tasks need to be completed to continue development:

- Create a backlog of all conceivable tasks that need to be completed
- Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable tasks
- Tasks should be small enough to be achieved by 1 person

### 5. First sprint planning

What can be achieved in the first sprint?

- Select tasks from the backlog that can contribute to the first sprint

### 6. Research technologies (optional)

Some groups may wish to use technologies beyond what has been taught on the curriculum; they may wish to discuss this during this phase.

### 7. Come up with a group name!

A fun little task; each group should come up with a group name to help with identification.
