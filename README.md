## Teams:

The team will share responsibilities but will also define roles:

- **Project Manager** - This role involves team communication and coordination. The Project Manager is responsible for arranging team meetings and ensuring the group's progress remains on course.

- **Repository Maintainer** - The Repository Maintainer is for enforcing correct GIT processes, including ensuring team members refrain from direct commits to the main/master branch. Additionally, they oversee the integration of new features through the PR (pull request) system.

- **Lead Frontend Developer** - This responsibility entails orchestrating front-end tasks and offering assistance to other frontend developers. Ideally, the Lead Frontend Developer should possess the most extensive experience among the frontend developers in the group.

- **Lead Backend Developer** - This role involves coordinating backend tasks and ensuring the efficient functioning of backend development processes.

> In corporate settings, teams are often assembled following this approach. However, in our learning environment, we'll be distributing responsibilities while emphasizing the significance of having a sole repository maintainer.

## Key points

- Each group will have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 participants
- Solo projects won't be presented at the final event and won't be mentioned on the final certificate.
- Teachers might not know all technologies;there's a chance they won't be able to assist you with topics they haven't covered.
- Avoid having an idea owner, where one person makes all the suggestions / decisions.
- When teachers are in the main room, it doesn't mean they can help you right away. They might be busy working on a problem with someone else's code or something else. It's better to use Slack, and we'll make sure to get back to you when it's your turn.
- For technical assistance, reach out to us. Monique is your go-to for social conflicts that might arise.
